TechBit Blog
Overview
TechBit is a modern, interactive blog page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view blog posts fetched from an API, submit comments, and delete comments, with data persisted across sessions using localStorage. The project fulfills the requirements of the Zemenay Team’s Week I and Week II mini projects:

Week I: Implements an interactive comment form with submission and display functionality.
Week II: Fetches and displays blog posts from JSONPlaceholder, with Latin-like placeholder text mapped to realistic English content, and is ready for GitHub deployment.

The blog features a professional, card-based UI with responsive design, mimicking real-world tech blogs like freeCodeCamp or Dev.to.
Features

Blog Posts: Displays 5 blog posts fetched from JSONPlaceholder’s /posts endpoint, with titles and bodies in realistic English (e.g., "Kickstarting Your Web Development Journey").
Comment System: Users can submit comments via a form, which are displayed below the posts. Comments persist using localStorage.
Delete Comments: Each comment has a delete button to remove it, with updates saved to localStorage.
Realistic English Content: JSONPlaceholder’s Latin-like text is mapped to engaging, blog-style English for both posts and comments.
Responsive Design: Card-based layout with hover effects, optimized for desktop and mobile (below 700px).
Error Handling: Displays a user-friendly message if the API fails to load posts.

JavaScript:

Event Listeners: Handles form submission and delete button clicks.
ES6 Features: Arrow functions, template literals, spread operator, destructuring.
Array Methods: map, forEach, filter for data handling.
LocalStorage: Persists user comments across sessions.
